# Using your YubiKey

The YubiKey is a hardware device manufactured by Yubico that provides a hardware "second factor" enabling true two-factor authentication: something you know (your password) and something you have (your YubiKey). It enables you to easily and securely log in to accounts by emitting one-time passwords or using a FIDO-based public/private key pair generated by the device.

For operation, simply plug it into an unused USB port. During certain types of authentication you will be prompted on screen to press the inset copper button marked with and (often lit) "Y".

Notes on installing and setting up your *YubiKey 4* for various platforms and applications.

## Basic Setup (do this first)
Before your YubiKey can act as a second (hardware) authentication token for applications, you need to install and configure some software that "personalizes" your YubiKey. Also included are some more advanced instructions that enable locking your screen with your YubiKey.

- [Mac OS X specific instructions](macosx.md)

## Enable YubiKey TFA for applications

### Lastpass
This requires a Yubikey OTP (cover the button for approximately one second) on laptop/desktop and a NFC contact on mobile to unlock LastPass.
- Vault -> Settings -> Multifactor options
- Set "Mobile" to disallowed
  - If you have a *YubiKey Neo* (not our standard model, the *YubiKey 4*) and your phone supports NFC, you can touch the Neo against your phone to unlock on mobile.

### Google
For each Google account you have:
- Visit https://accounts.google.com/b/0/SmsAuthSettings#devices
- Enable TFA, and complete the phone verification process (phone will act as backup TFA).
- Click on "Security Keys" and follow instructions to add Yubikey.
- Return to the main page and add a second phone and/or print backup codes.
- As long as you have a backup, you can also install the Yubikey Authenticator app, and configure your account to use that for the backup TFA instead of SMS/phone - this is the same as the Google Authenticator app, except that it stores the credentials on your Yubikey instead of the phone.
- If you have funky devices/apps that don't support TFA, you can set an application specific password using that tab. This includes sending E-mail from your personal Gmail account using your civicactions.com IMAP, for instance.

### AWS Root Account
For each AWS account you have:
- Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#security_credential
- Under MFA, add a Virtual MFA device.
- Use Yubikey Authenticator app to scan the QR code, and enter the reponse code, then close and reopen the app and enter the second response code.

### AWS IAM Account
- Visit https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#users
- Choose your user name
- Click on Manage your MFA device
- Use Google Authenticator app to scan the QR code, and enter the reponse code
- then close and reopen the app and enter the second response code.
- _using YubiKey untested - don't have Yubikey Authenticator set up_
